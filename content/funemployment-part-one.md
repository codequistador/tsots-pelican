Summary: THE ADVENTURE BEGINS

The following is the tale of 17 days of funemployment. I got a new job, quit my old one, and started planning an epic adventure. Why not, right? I live in Utah after all, the land of a million cool things to do.

The adventure started on Monday, February 1. POWDER DAY! Brighton Resort got absolutely dumped on the night before due to a strangely persistent cloud. 11 inches of fluffy Wasatch powder. I was lapping Western all morning with abundant first tracks until about 11am. It was an epic and tiring day.

After a relaxing Tuesday, Wednesday rolled around. It was my birthday! I had a great day doing yoga, climbing, having lunch with Teresa at Takashi, and dinner with the fam&hellip;  minus Cara and Gareth&hellip; at Market Street Grill. A perfect birthday.

On Thursday morning I set out for a 6 day road trip for the record books. My first destination; Zion National Park. I spent the afternoon riding my bike up Zion Canyon before heading to Kanab. There I enjoyed a delicious meal at a restaurant called Sego. Pistachio Olive Toast, Foraged Mushrooms, Salmon Belly, and a damn good Manhattan left me satisfied and sleepy.

Friday was strange. The funeral for famed public lands protester LaVoy Finicum was scheduled for later that day and the vibes in Kanab were tense. Most locals were told to leave town until the events were over. Even the BLM office was closed. I had hoped to get a permit to hike The Wave, but alas, no BLM = no permit. I decided to get out of there as soon as I was able and make for Buckskin Gulch instead.

Buckskin Gulch is often ranked as one of the most dangerous hikes in the world. It is over 13 miles long. If a flash flood comes roaring through you are pretty much screwed. Luckily the skies were clear in every direction that day. I hiked the scenic 1.7 miles from the Wire Pass trailhead to Wire Pass. Petroglyph panels lined the towering sandstone walls. The canyon shot out in both directions and narrowed to arms-length at times. I was the only one in there the entire hike.

After an extremely muddy drive back to the highway I headed to Saint George where I would meet Teresa and some friends for more fun!

Saint George felt like spring. Palm trees lined the streets. I drove to a shop called The Desert Rat for some supplies and information. There I learned about camping near Moe’s Valley Climbing Area and a nearby mountain bike trail called Bear Claw Poppy. We found a perfect campsite close to the bouldering area and the mountain bike trail and set up camp. Friday night there was much revelry and merriment as the spirits took over and the stars shone bright.

Saturday brought with it more sunshine and an excitement to explore. After breakfast we all suited up and rode our mountain bikes to the Bear Claw Poppy trail. The trail was in amazing shape and we enjoyed two smile-filled laps on the roller coaster-like trail. We returned to camp, had lunch, chilled out, and walked to Moe’s Valley to do some bouldering. We found a couple great boulders and worked on them until the sun went down. The spirits were strong again that night. We went to bed a deep tired.

Sunday saw Teresa and Tina head back to SLC while Andrew and Emma and I made our way to Zion National Park. Emma had never hiked Angel’s Landing before, so we decided to give it a go. The usually busy hike was empty, but icy! The last 1/4 mile was gnarly. We had to make a few quick decisions as to whether or not to continue. Andrew and I made it to the top while Emma waited on a rock for us to return.

Upon our safe return to the canyon floor Andrew and Emma returned to Salt Lake City and I made for Page Arizona.

In Page I enjoyed a shower, a nice dinner at the bar while watching the Super Bowl, a great conversation with a local Pageian? Pageite? I dunno..., a soak in the hot tub, another shower, and a glorious night of sleep. Little did I know, Monday was going to be amazing.
