Title: Albion Basin to Catherine's Pass... and Beyond!
Date: 2015-02-02 10:00
Summary: IT'S A DEEP TIRED.

As with most Sundays, I decided to use this one for hiking. Today's destination: Catherine's pass between Little and Big Cottonwood canyons.

I love driving up Little Cottonwood Canyon. Immediately after entering the canyon, the scenery shifts dramatically upward. Granite slabs rise thousands of feet on either side. In just over 8 miles, travelers gain 3400 feet of elevation. Add that to your "brutal climbs" cycling bucket list.

Let's get down to business. This hike starts and ends at <a href="http://www.alta.com" target="_blank">Alta Ski Resort</a>. After driving through the alpine village of Alta, park anywhere you can and head toward the snow-covered summer road. For a couple of miles head up the hard-packed snow cat trail until you reach the top of the Albion chairlift. Be sure to stay out of the way of the "happy Alta skiers!"

This is where it gets tricky, and fun! Follow the skin track (without trampling it with your snowshoes) opposite the Albion lift. Follow the trail (or make your own) along the base of mt. Wolverine until you reach a run aptly named "snowshoe hill." The section between the Albion lift and snowshoe hill can be dangerous avalanche terrain in the right conditions, even for snowshoers, so be sure to read the daily <a href="http://www.utahavalanchecenter.org/" target="_blank">UAC Avalanche report</a> and be mindful when choosing your route.

Snowshoe hill is a beautiful gully that opens up as Mt. Wolverine relents. At this point you are back in bounds at Alta, so be mindful of those "happy Alta skiers." They really are happy and nice... Even to snowshoers! Keep heading up the gulley until you find a wide open field on the edge of the Alta boundary. Mt. Wolverine looms large over your left shoulder while Catherine's pass becomes visible ahead. Continue uphill more or less straight until you reach the ridge. If you don't see other snowshoe tracks to follow, make your own!

Upon reaching Catherine's pass, you will be treated to a great view of big cottonwood canyon and <a href="http://www.brightonresort.com/" target="_blank">Brighton Ski Resort</a>. (Check out their website... I built it!) This is a very popular area for backcountry skiing, so you are likely to see some epic action. There are a number of peaks you can reach from here. Turn left and put in a good shift and you will find yourself atop mt. Wolverine. Turn right and you can visit rocky point, sunset peak, or pioneer peak. The final destination of today's hike was rocky point.

After a short but challenging climb up the ridge from Catherine's pass, you find yourself in majestic surroundings. Nearby Mt. Wolverine and Sunset Peak dominate the foreground while Timpanogos and the Uintas impress from afar. The air is pure up there. Each breath tastes, smells, and feels like a gift. I'm always thankful to find a few moments of perfect peace and quiet in the mountains.

The way down (a similar route as the way up, with some fun detours for powder snowshoeing) was filled with sliding, a few hilarious spills, and a lot of smiles. Another amazing day in the Wasatch.

### Route details:

**Distance:** 6-7 miles depending on route choices

**Elevation Gain:** 1500 ft

**Notes:** Moderate difficulty. Avalanche awareness is important, especially along the base of Mt. Wolverine. A compass/map or a smartphone with good GPS is always helpful.
