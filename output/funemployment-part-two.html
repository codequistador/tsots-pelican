<p>I woke up Monday morning with a renewed energy. I hit the road feeling good. As I headed from Page to Monument Valley I was scanning the radio for tunes. I happened upon KUYI 88.1 Hopi Radio. A beautiful mix of modern and traditional native american songs and orations filled my ears and added a timeless feel to the drive through northern Arizona. I arrived at Monument Valley ready to explore.</p>
<p>Monument Valley blew me away. The vast expanse of land is interrupted only by amazing sandstone formations. After a quick stop in the visitors center I began the 17 mile scenic drive. Each stop gave a unique perspective of the area and I had most of them all to myself. At the fourth stop I had the pleasure of riding a horse out to a scenic point and having my picture taken. It was a magic moment that I will never forget.</p>

<p>I had a quick lunch at one of the lookouts while enjoying the scenery and sunshine and by 1pm I was on my way to Bluff, UT for my next adventure.</p>
<p>I headed to Bluff to do some volunteering with DesignBuildBluff, a group of students from the U who are building an education center for the Bluff community. I arrived and was greeted by my friend Dani who showed me around the campus and put me to work. I spent the afternoon sorting 2x6s and helping prepare dinner for 15 hungry students. After work Dani and I set out for a quick hike before dinner. Just around the corner from the campus is a set of amazing petroglyphs. We walked back as an astonishing sunset painted the sky.</p>

<p>I left Bluff early on Tuesday and drove towards Moab. My plan for the day was to try to ride the world famous Slickrock mountain bike trail. When I got there I found an empty parking lot but I thought I’d give it a try. A half mile into the ride I realized why the parking lot was empty. The north facing rock was literally slick with ice and snow. I turned around and headed towards plan B, Arches National Park. In Arches I rode my mountain bike down a snowy and sometimes muddy dirt road to “Eye of the Whale Arch”. It was awesome to see a part of Arches that I had not seen before.</p>

<p>I returned to Salt Lake City to find it choked in smog. I spent the next few days studying in Park City, snowboarding at Brighton, and trail running in Mill Creek Canyon. Above the smog, the air was clean, warm, and felt like spring. People were noticeably happier above the heavily polluted valley.</p>

<p>The last two days of funemployement took me to Red Pine Lake in Little Cottonwood Canyon and Lava Hot Springs for a quick getaway with Teresa. The hike to Red Pine showcased the amount of snow we have received this winter; a veritable shit-ton! We enjoyed the clean air and immaculate views with a new friend. On Sunday, Teresa and I drove to Lava Hot Springs, Idaho for a delicious soak in mineral-filled waters. It was the perfect finale to a perfect two weeks.</p>

<p>By the end of my seventeen days of funemployment my mind was noticeably quiet. I was overwhelmingly stressed at my last job and had forgotten what it was like to have peace of mind. Each moment between jobs returned more peace and joy to my life. I am thankful to live in a place with so many life-giving outdoor adventures. I am even more thankful for the opportunity to experience them. If you ever find yourself in Utah, hit me up! I would love to show you around.</p>
